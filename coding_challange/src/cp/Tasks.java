/*
* Given a list of tasks with deadlines and total profit earned on completing a task, find the maximum profit earned by executing the tasks within the specified deadlines. Assume that each task takes one unit of time to complete, and a task canâ€™t execute beyond its deadline. Also, only a single task will be executed at a time.

For example, consider the following set of tasks with a deadline and the profit associated with it. If we choose tasks 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, we can achieve a maximum profit of 109. Note that task 2 and task 10 are left out.
Tasks	Deadlines	Profit
1	9	15
2	2	2
3	5	18
4	7	1
5	4	25
6	2	20
7	5	8
8	7	10
9	4	12
10	3	5
